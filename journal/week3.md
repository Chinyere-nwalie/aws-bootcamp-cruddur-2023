# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

- Decentralized Authentication is an extension of the concept that was shared by oath and openID. You can store your user at one creation without creating multiple
means of profile. I understood the concepts clearly with [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9obl7rVgzJw&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=40)

Amazon cognito is a service that is all about username, user credentials, authentication that allow users store information locally and quickly in your account, it 
provides an identity store that scales to millions of users, supports social and enterprise identity federation federated identity providers is when you want to be 
able to login like a social identity from another provider., This is divided into two. User pool and Identity pool.

User pool is your authentication using oath, it is when you're creating web applications and you want to add login and signup you can add different methods of
IPD'S(identity providers). Identity pool allows an application to request for temporary credentials it acts like an access broker. It is also essential to keep 
confidential your region data when performing a decentralized authentication. [learn more here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEJIeII66pY&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=39)

- It is essential to note user lifecycle management is identities in cloud. When we login, a profile is created. This is to intergrate into an application with custom logins.

AWS Cognito

- Amazon Cognito allows authentication with users then store it locally in your amazon account -> (user directory).

The two type of amazon cognito are: Cognito User Pool -- This help to grant access to your Applications, And : Cognito Identity Pool -- This enables access to Amazon services.

I created an Amazon Cognito User Pool.

- How I set up UserPool in AWS Cognito

I Logged in my your AWS Console and Checked my region for my service. My region is `us-east-1` 

Search for Cognito service and then UserPool tab, click on UserPool -> Create UserPool.

It displayed  **Authentication providers** page I Inputed my Username and Email for Cognito user pool sign-in options -> click Next and kept my Password Policy as Cognito Default.

I didn't select Multi-factor authentication, In User account recovery -> checkbox --Email only--and Under Required attributes I selected -Name- and --preferred username--

I choose --Send email with Cognito-- for first time after that, I was asked to give my User Pool Name , I named it as --cruddur-user-pool--  and under Initial app client I kept it as --Public client-- and entered my app client name --(eg: cruddur)--

I verified all my filled details and then click on --Create User Pool-- this was how my userpool was created.

I installed and configured Amplify client-side library for Amazon Congnito as it is development platform and provides you set of pre-built UI components and Libraries.
```
npm i aws-amplify --save
```
- To Configure Amplify
I added this code in `app.js` of frontend-react-js directory.
```js
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';

Amplify.configure({
  "AWS_PROJECT_REGION": process.env.REACT_AWS_PROJECT_REGION,
  "aws_cognito_identity_pool_id": process.env.REACT_APP_AWS_COGNITO_IDENTITY_POOL_ID,
  "aws_cognito_region": process.env.REACT_APP_AWS_COGNITO_REGION,
  "aws_user_pools_id": process.env.REACT_APP_AWS_USER_POOLS_ID,
  "aws_user_pools_web_client_id": process.env.REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID,
  "oauth": {},
  Auth: {
    // We are not using an Identity Pool
    // identityPoolId: process.env.REACT_APP_IDENTITY_POOL_ID, // REQUIRED - Amazon Cognito Identity Pool ID
    region: process.env.REACT_AWS_PROJECT_REGION,           // REQUIRED - Amazon Cognito Region
    userPoolId: process.env.REACT_APP_AWS_USER_POOLS_ID,         // OPTIONAL - Amazon Cognito User Pool ID
    userPoolWebClientId: process.env.REACT_APP_AWS_USER_POOLS_WEB_CLIENT_ID,   // OPTIONAL - Amazon Cognito Web Client ID (26-char alphanumeric string)
  }
});
```
After installation, mine was  `"aws-amplify": "^5.0.16",` in my frontend-react-js directory's `package.json` file.

I also confirmed email address and my client user being active.

![client_user](assets/active%20user%20week%203_LI.jpg)

- To check the authentication process, I added this code in my `HomeFeedPage.js`
```js
import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify';

// set a state
const [user, setUser] = React.useState(null);

// check if we are authenicated
const checkAuth = async () => {
  Auth.currentAuthenticatedUser({
    // Optional, By default is false. 
    // If set to true, this call will send a 
    // request to Cognito to get the latest user data
    bypassCache: false 
  })
  .then((user) => {
    console.log('user',user);
    return Auth.currentAuthenticatedUser()
  }).then((cognito_user) => {
      setUser({
        display_name: cognito_user.attributes.name,
        handle: cognito_user.attributes.preferred_username
      })
  })
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
};

// check when the page loads if we are authenicated
React.useEffect(()=>{
  loadData();
  checkAuth();
}, [])
```

After configuring, I gave it an attribute name and it was displaying on my cruddure frontendapp.

I Implemented API calls to Amazon Cognito for custom login, signup, recovery and forgot password page. I received a cofirmation email to login.

- I added these scripts in my `DesktopNavigation.js` file which helps to check if I am Logged in or not by passing the`user` to `ProfileInfo`.
```js
import './DesktopNavigation.css';
import {ReactComponent as Logo} from './svg/logo.svg';
import DesktopNavigationLink from '../components/DesktopNavigationLink';
import CrudButton from '../components/CrudButton';
import ProfileInfo from '../components/ProfileInfo';

export default function DesktopNavigation(props) {

  let button;
  let profile;
  let notificationsLink;
  let messagesLink;
  let profileLink;
  if (props.user) {
    button = <CrudButton setPopped={props.setPopped} />;
    profile = <ProfileInfo user={props.user} />;
    notificationsLink = <DesktopNavigationLink 
      url="/notifications" 
      name="Notifications" 
      handle="notifications" 
      active={props.active} />;
    messagesLink = <DesktopNavigationLink 
      url="/messages"
      name="Messages"
      handle="messages" 
      active={props.active} />
    profileLink = <DesktopNavigationLink 
      url="/@andrewbrown" 
      name="Profile"
      handle="profile"
      active={props.active} />
  }

  return (
    <nav>
      <Logo className='logo' />
      <DesktopNavigationLink url="/" 
        name="Home"
        handle="home"
        active={props.active} />
      {notificationsLink}
      {messagesLink}
      {profileLink}
      <DesktopNavigationLink url="/#" 
        name="More" 
        handle="more"
        active={props.active} />
      {button}
      {profile}
    </nav>
  );
}
```

I clicked on forgot page and I got a password reset code.

- Verify JWT Token side to serve authenticated API endpoints in Flask Application.

Implementing server side verification using JWT, I understood how to use codes for verification, authentication and authorization purposes. Using JWT(JSON Web Token)  It is more straight forward because I would not use another external resource. It was instructed to create a user token, it helps to fetch user data when the user logs in and if user logs out then for that the token was unset. 


- I also changed the UI of my cruddur App by implementing and writing CSS scripts in my Front-end.
