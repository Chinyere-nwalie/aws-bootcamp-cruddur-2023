In order to access databases
```sh
echo "db-create"

NO_DB_CONNECTION_URL=$(sed 's/\/cruddur//g' <<<"$CONNECTION_URL")
psql $NO_DB_CONNECTION_URL -c "create database cruddur;"./bin/db-drop to drop database
```

```sh
echo "db-schema-load"
psql $CONNECTION_URL cruddur < db/schema.sql``
to acced db-scheam-load
