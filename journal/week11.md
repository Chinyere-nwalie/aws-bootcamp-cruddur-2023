## Pre-Requisites

- A publicly accessible bucket that was created via `./bin/cfn/frontend`
- Cloudfront distribution that was created via `./bin/cfn/frontend`
---

### Create Build scripts

Create the following scripts `static-build` and `sync` in `bin/frontend` and set them as executable

```sh
touch bin/frontend/static-build
touch bin/frontend/sync
chmod u+x bin/frontend/static-build
chmod u+x bin/frontend/sync
```

Create a new file `erb/sync.env.erb` that holds the environment variables for the `bin/frontend/sync` script

```sh
touch erb/sync.env.erb
```

Add the following, replace `SYNC_S3_BUCKET` and `SYNC_CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID` with your own.

```erb
SYNC_S3_BUCKET=nwaliechinyere.xyz
SYNC_CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID=E32MCTPMMZNR3
SYNC_BUILD_DIR=<%= ENV['THEIA_WORKSPACE_ROOT'] %>/frontend-react-js/build
SYNC_OUTPUT_CHANGESET_PATH=<%=  ENV['THEIA_WORKSPACE_ROOT'] %>/tmp/changeset.json
SYNC_AUTO_APPROVE=false
```

Create the following files in the root of the repository

- Gemfile
- Rakefile

```sh
touch Gemfile
touch Rakefile
```

The code for these files is located respectively here [Gemfile](https://github.com/Chinyere-nwalie/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/Gemfile) and here [Rakefile](https://github.com/Chinyere-nwalie/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/Rakefile).

Create the following file `./tmp/.keep` as a placeholder

```sh
touch tmp/.keep
```

Create a `sync` script in `bin/cfn`

```sh
touch bin/cfn/sync
chmod u+x bin/cfn/sync
```

Update `bin/cfn/sync` with the following [code](https://github.com/Chinyere-nwalie/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/bin/cfn/sync)

### Create Sync Template

```sh
cd /workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023
mkdir -p  aws/cfn/sync
touch aws/cfn/sync/template.yaml aws/cfn/sync/config.toml aws/cfn/sync/config.toml.example
```

Update config.toml with the following settings that specify the bucket, region and name of the CFN stack. Replace `bucket` and `region` with your own.

We also need to specify the GitHubOrg which in our case will correspond to our GitHub username and the GitHub Repository name

```toml
[deploy]
bucket = 'nwaliechinyere-cfn-artifacts'
region = 'nwaliechinyere.xyz'
stack_name = 'CrdSyncRole'

[parameters]
GitHubOrg = 'Chinyere-nwalie'
RepositoryName = 'aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023'
OIDCProviderArn = ''
```

Update `aws/cfn/sync/template.yaml` with the following [code](https://github.com/Chinyere-nwalie/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/aws/cfn/template.yaml)

## Initialise Static Hosting

- Run Static-Build script

Run build script `./bin/frontend/build` , you should see output similar to the following when successful.

```console
The build folder is ready to be deployed.
You may serve it with a static server:

  npm install -g serve
  serve -s build

Find out more about deployment here:

  https://cra.link/deployment
```

Change to the frontend directory and zip the build folder

```sh
cd frontend-react-js
zip -r build.zip build/
```

The steps within the video recommended downloading the zip file locally and then uploading it to the s3 bucket. 

I verified everything had been zipped successfully before uploading in s3

### Initialise Sync

In the root of the repository

- Install the pre-requisite ruby gems `gem install aws_s3_website_sync dotenv`
- Generate `sync.env` by running updated `./bin/frontend/generate-env`
- Initiate synchronisation './bin/frontend/sync'
- Create CFN Sync `CrdSyncRole` stack by running `./bin/cfn/sync`

### Create GitHub Action

Create folder in base of repo for action

```sh
mkdir -p .github/workflows/
touch .github/workflows/sync.yaml
```

Update with the following. Replace `role-to-assume` with the role generated in `CrdSyncRole` and `aws-region` with the region your stack was created in.

```yaml
name: Sync-Prod-Frontend

on:
  push:
    branches: [ prod ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ prod ]

jobs:
  build:
    name: Statically Build Files
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [ 18.x]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - run: cd frontend-react-js
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
  deploy:
    name: Sync Static Build to S3 Bucket
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # These permissions are needed to interact with GitHub's OIDC Token endpoint.
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Configure AWS credentials from Test account
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::797130574998:role/CrdSyncRole-Role-VW38RM6ZXJ6W
          aws-region: eu-west-2
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Ruby
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@ec02537da5712d66d4d50a0f33b7eb52773b5ed1
        with:
          ruby-version: '3.1'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: bundle install
      - name: Run tests
        run: bundle exec rake sync
```

These were addressed by commenting out the following import line

`import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';`

## CFN CI/CD Stack

### Create CI/CD Template

Create the folder structure.

```sh
cd /workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023
mkdir -p  aws/cfn/cicd
cd aws/cfn/cicd
touch template.yaml config.toml
```

The CI/CD stack requires a nested codebuild stack so a directory needs to be created for it too.

```sh
cd /workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023
mkdir -p  aws/cfn/cicd/nested
cd aws/cfn/cicd/nested
touch codebuild.yaml
```

Update the files with the following code.

- ["aws/cfn/cicd/template.yaml"](https://github.com/Chinyere-nwalie/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/aws/cfn/cicd/template.yaml)
- ["aws/cfn/cicd/config.toml"](https://github.com/Chinyere-nwalie/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/aws/cfn/cicd/config.toml)
- ["aws/cfn/cicd/nested/codebuild.yaml"](../aws/cfn/cicd/nested/codebuild.yaml)

`aws/cfn/cicd/config.toml` structure

```toml
[deploy]
bucket = 'nwaliechinyere-cfn-artifacts'
region = 'us-east-1'
stack_name = 'CrdCicd'

[parameters]
ServiceStack = 'CrdSrvBackendFlask'
ClusterStack = 'CrdCluster'
GitHubBranch = 'prod'
GithubRepo = 'Chinyere-nwalie/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023'
ArtifactBucketName = "codepipeline-nwaliechinyere-cruddur-artifacts"
BuildSpec = 'backend-flask/buildspec.yml'
```

### Issues during CI/CD stack deployment

Error on First Run as Pipeline Execution Fails

![image](cicdfailing.png)

---

The connection shows as pending
![image](cicdpending.png)

---

![image](cicdconnecting.png)

---

Pipeline still fails saying `[GitHub] No Branch [prod] found for FullRepositoryName [aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023]` at the Build stage

To resolve this change the following setting `GithubRepo` in `aws/cfn/cicd/config.toml` to include the account name e.g

`GithubRepo = 'Chinyere-nwalie/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023'`

Build succeeded after updating concerning code build and buildspec.yml

## CFN MachineUser Stack

A Machine User: generally refers to a user account or identity used for automated processes or machine-to-machine communication. It's often associated with tasks performed by scripts, applications, or services rather than interactive human users. 
The "CFN MachineUser Stack" was created to manage resources related to a machine user (In our Cruddur CFN machine user template automatically created a machine user in IAM and gave it a role). CFN MachineUser Stack creation could include the provisioning of IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles, policies, or other resources associated with a machine user account.

### Here are some possible reasons why this stack was created:

- Automation: The stack was part of an automated process for setting up machine user accounts in our Cruddur app and its associated resources.

- Security Policies: The stack defined IAM policies and roles with the least privilege principle, ensuring that the machine user has only the necessary permissions.

- Consistency: By using CloudFormation, we ensured that the creation and management of machine user resources were consistent and reproducible.

**Note** In terms of Scalability for your future application: If you have multiple machine users or need to scale resources based on demand, CloudFormation allows you to manage the infrastructure in a scalable way.

---
1. **Create MachineUser Template**

```sh
cd /workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023
mkdir -p  aws/cfn/machine-user
cd aws/cfn/machine-user
touch template.yaml config.toml
```

2. Update `aws/cfn/machine-user/template.yaml` with the following code.

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"
Resources:
  CruddurMachineUser:
    Type: "AWS::IAM::User"
    Properties:
      UserName: "cruddur_machine_user"
  DynamoDBFullAccessPolicy:
    Type: "AWS::IAM::Policy"
    Properties:
      PolicyName: "DynamoDBFullAccessPolicy"
      PolicyDocument:
        Version: "2012-10-17"
        Statement:
          - Effect: Allow
            Action:
              - dynamodb:PutItem
              - dynamodb:GetItem
              - dynamodb:Scan
              - dynamodb:Query
              - dynamodb:UpdateItem
              - dynamodb:DeleteItem
              - dynamodb:BatchWriteItem
            Resource: "*"
      Users:
        - !Ref CruddurMachineUser
```

Update config.toml with the following changing `bucket` and `region` as appropriate

```config
[deploy]
bucket = 'nwaliechinyere-cfn-artifacts'
region = 'us-east-1'
stack_name = 'CrdMachineUser'
```


3. **Create MachineUser Deploy Script**

```sh
cd /workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023
mkdir -p  bin/cfn
cd bin/cfn
touch machineuser-deploy
chmod u+x machineuser-deploy
```

4. Update the script with the following [code](https://github.com/Chinyere-nwalie/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/bin/cfn/machineuser)

Running `./bin/cfn/machineuser-deploy` now initiates a changeset for the CFN stack.

**NOTE**

I created a new script to automatically update uuid

Similar to the `update_cognito_user_ids` script used to update cognito uuid, being that I have created another user, I need a new script for updating uuid so I made a new script with the help of my bootcamp team mate. After pasting this while my container was running I then included this in both my `.gitpod.yml` script named `update-dev-uuid`

```sh
UPDATE public.users 
SET uuid = '2290b744-8381-4409-a3f2-f4c417a952de'
WHERE users.handle = 'nwalie chinyere';

UPDATE public.users 
SET uuid = 'ab7423df-5546-4974-8819-c283a90e8b78'
WHERE users.handle = 'cloudgeekchie';
```

## Troubleshooting & Cleanup part 1

Another issue I was faced with was the fact that when I deleted my main user in Cognito, while signing-in I mistakenly gave spacing in the username I wrote it as `nwalie chinyere` instead of `nwaliechinyere`, and in SQL you don't leave spacing in name. In my research, it said Leaving a space in a username in SQL is generally not recommended, While some database systems may allow it, unfortunately, mine didn't allow it, hence it was throwing errors in my username on my production link URL as `@nwalie%20chinyere` and unknowingly because of this issues I didn't know how to solve it so I kept signing in my main handle multiple times on Local database instead of my production. In the pic below look closely and see that the url is altered

I connected to my local database in my terminal with the `./bin/db-connect` code to delete users. I used this code to delete
```sh
DELETE FROM your_table_name
WHERE your_condition_column = your_condition_value;
```

I modified the [kill=all](https://github.com/Chinyere-nwalie/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/backend-flask/db/kill-all-connections.sql) script

Then I killed all connections, ran the [setup](https://github.com/Chinyere-nwalie/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/bin/db/setup) to drop & create a database

A boot camper helped me in creating this [update.sql](https://github.com/Chinyere-nwalie/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/backend-flask/db/sql/users/update.sql) script to;
```sh
UPDATE public.users
    SET uuid = <PROD_UUID>
    WHERE
      users.handle = <USER_HANDLE>;
```
- I Pasted this code below manually in my `db-connection` on my terminal to update the users to that of mine
```sh
UPDATE public.users 
SET uuid = 'mu uuid'
WHERE users.handle = 'nwaliechinyere';

UPDATE public.users 
SET uuid = 'new user uuid'
WHERE users.handle = 'cloudgeekchie';
```
It's was Updated!
