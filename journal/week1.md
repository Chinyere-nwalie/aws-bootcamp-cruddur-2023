# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

* I added a dockerfile to my backendfile with this commands
```sh
# This code will fetch the specified python image from the docker hub
FROM python:3.10-slim-buster

WORKDIR /backend-flask

# This will copy the requirements.txt file into the image. This txt file is currently inside the backend-flask folder
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt

# This will install all programs/softwares which is required to run our backend 
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# This will copy every folder inside the image which I am trying to make
COPY . .


ENV FLASK_ENV=development

# This will expose the port specified in our case its 4567
EXPOSE ${PORT}

# This will run our backend via flask module of python
CMD [ "python3", "-m" , "flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=4567"]
 ```
* I made a docker container to run in the backend with these commands
```docker
docker build -t  backend-flask ./backend-flask
```

* I Built and Ran the container with these commands

```sh
To build = docker build -t  backend-flask ./backend-flask
 
To Run = docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it backend-flask
```
 * After running i unset them all
 ```sh
 unset FRONTEND_URL="*"
 unset BACKEND_URL="*"
```
-  I created and deleted the container images
```sh
 To create = 
 docker ps
 docker images
 deleted= {docker image rm backend-flask --force
 ```

-  I tested the backend server and made sure the port was work and public
 ```sh
 {
 curl -X GET http://localhost:4567/api/activities/home -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
 }
 ```

After running the command I can open the backend into the browser via URL which is present into the gitpod "PORTS". I made the URL public and I opened the URL and found that its giving me 404 error which is good sign it means the backend is running

I installed npm in my Gitpod terminal

```sh
npm i
```

* I Created a Dockerfile into the frontend-react-js folder

```Dockerfile
# This will fetch the specified node image
FROM node:16.18

# This will set the environment variable 
ENV PORT=3000

# This will copy the whole frontend-reeact-js folder into the container 
COPY . /frontend-react-js

WORKDIR /frontend-react-js

# This will install the npm software/program into the container
RUN npm install

# This will expose the port
EXPOSE ${PORT}

# This will start the frontend
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

To test the backend I ran these commands to run the frontend 

```
# To build the image
docker build -t frontend-react-js ./frontend-react-js

# To run the container exposing the port 3000
docker run -p 3000:3000 frontend-react-js
# I containerized my backend app successfully with this commands
```sh
cd backend-flask
export FRONTEND_URL="*"
export BACKEND_URL="*"
 python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4567
 cd ..
 ```

# I Created a Docker composed file
```sh
 version: "3.8"
 services:
  backend-flask:
   environment:
     FRONTEND_URL: "https://3000-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}"
      BACKEND_URL: "https://4567-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}"
    build: ./backend-flask
    ports:
       "4567:4567"
    volumes:
       ./backend-flask:/backend-flask
  frontend-react-js:
    environment:
      REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL: "https://4567-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}"
    build: ./frontend-react-js
    ports:
       "3000:3000"
    volumes:
       ./frontend-react-js:/frontend-react-js
      networks: 
  internal-network:
    driver: bridge
    name: cruddur
```

# Lastly
- I added Cloned the backend and frontend and made it run
```sh
 FRONTEND_URL="*" BACKEND_URL="*" docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it backend-flask

 docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it  -e FRONTEND_URL -e BACKEND_URL backend-flask
```
- Also made some changes to the frontend notifications.js file, notifications.py file, app.py file and commited all changes made.
- NB: When the server refuses to load, I use the command {gp stop} in my terminal to stop the workspace and start again and it worked successfully.
