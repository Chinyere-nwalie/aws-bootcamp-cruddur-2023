## Overview

This week we will be cleaning up all the codes in our application making and ensuring it is stable and clean.

---

## CleanUp for Cruddur

This involved the following

- Refactoring of codes
- Reimporting TimeDateCodes, profile, and CSS in the app
- Fixing missing settings in CloudFormation stacks correctly
- Adding a new user to our Cruddur application to ensure the least privileged access
- Refactor to use JWT decorator in the application
- Implementing replies
- Improve error handling

---

## Messaging Alt User

I used the following URL to message my altUser in Production: `https://nwaliechinyere.xyz/messages/new/cloudgeekchie`

---

## Allowing Production to upload images

To allow messaging, the following changes need to be made from my experience

- Update the CORS Policy for the avatars bucket to change the `AllowedOrigins` to the production domain
- In the CruddurAvatarUpload Lambda edit `function.rb` to the production domain. Make sure not to have a trailing slash i.e it should be `https://nwaliechinyere.xyz`
- Add the `PUT` method in `/api/profile/update` under `backend-flask/routes/users.py`
- Update the CORS Policy for the avatars bucket to change the `AllowedMethods` as `POST,PUT`

## Troubleshooting

### Issues

- Tasks in GitPod and AWS CLI stopped running because `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` had been set and was causing issues
- CI/CD configuration error
- The reply function was not working due to me breaking a line of code,  I had to figure out what the issue was by debugging.
- Rollbar stopped working despite working earlier with no errors thrown, I stopped it from working.
- Earlier on in the boot camp I made an error in the seed script and included space when filling a new username, I had to delete it manually in my database
- Uploading in production was causing CORS issues. In addition to adding permissions to the `nwaliechinyere.xyz` domain, this was resolved by adding the `PUT` method in `/api/profile/update` under `backend-flask/routes/users.py`

### Issues during CI/CD stack deployment

Error on First Run as Pipeline Execution Fails

The connection shows as pending

---

Pipeline still fails saying `[GitHub] No Branch [prod] found for FullRepositoryName [aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023]` at the Build stage

To resolve this change the following setting `GithubRepo` in `aws/cfn/cicd/config.toml` to include the account name e.g

`GithubRepo = 'Chinyere-nwalie/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023'`

Build succeeded after updating concerning code build and buildspec.yml

## Update Lambda

A new security group was created for the Post Confirmation Lambda.

In `CrdDbRDSSG` created a rule to allow connectivity as it was previously connected to the default VPC.

---

### Add Rule to `CrdDbRDSSG` SG to allow connection from Lambda

### Warnings being shown when running static build

These were addressed by commenting out the following import line

`import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';`

---

## All CFN Stacks Created

All stacks were deployed successfully

 > All these while I was running on an AWS Free tier account that expired on Jan 31st, I had to tear down all the CFN stacks, and all projects to avoid costs

 > Gitpod.yml isn't free to work with, so I was careful spinning up a new environment when working and fixing errors
